# Project 1 : Frequential analysis

## Authors : Cotton Ian - 55019 | Henin Aur√©lian 56870

## Technologies used

We decided to implement our project with java-maven. Then we used an MVC structure 
with a command pattern that manages the interpretation of the user input. 

### How to execute the programm : 

2 Files are given to the user, the input.txt and output.txt at the root of our repository, please, don't move, remove or rename it or you
won't be able to use each available command of our project. <br>
We already provide a compiled version of our project with the .jar in the target folder.
However, if you want to compile it on your own, we have 2 other ways to do so.

### Technique 1 | compile and execute manually the program : 

1. Place yourself in the parent directory of src (in the directory that contains the src directory, the pom, the README, etc....)

2. Compile the program using this command : 
    javac -d .\src\main\java\  -cp .\src\main\java\   .\src\main\java\main\*.java

3. Execute the program using this command :
    java -cp  .\src\main\java\   .\src\main\java\main\main.java


#### Technique 2 | Execute the given jar in the target folder : 

1. Open the cmd

2. java -jar target/Frequential_analysis-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

3. To exit the program just use the command exit.


#### Technique 3 | Recompile using maven and execute the jar : 

1. Open the cmd at the root of the project 

2. Maven clean install (it will produce the jar in a new target folder)

3. java -jar target/Frequential_analysis-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


## List of Commands

Upper or lower cases doesn't influence the comportment.
The '_' character will be used to split the parts of the command.

1. To display the available commands : HELP 
2. Exit the program : EXIT
3. To encode a message with the given key : ENCODE_KEY_MESSAGE  
4. To decode a message with the given key : DECODE_KEY_MESSAGE   
5. To a crack a message without any key : CRACK_MESSAGE   
6. To interpret the command from the input.txt file : FILE

The input.txt file must contain one of the other command with the full structure.
